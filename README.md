Combination automatcion api (backend) and management interface (frontend)

the two express functions, iotconfig and iotfw are all that's needed for the automatic api to do it's thing, well and the mysql table nodelist


Goals:

Package.json needs to be cleaned up, I don't think I'm using everything that's in there

Combine nodecontrol with nodedetails - jquery mobile pop up window maybe?

Retire nodelist page, its been replaced with nodedetails

Lots more database maintenance tools needed.

Other info:

Yeah, it's a mess. I'm a hardware guy, and generally scatterbrain when it comes to programming.

Project relies on a mysql database, I will post table defs shortly.
